# **Assessing and reviewing each other** {#assessing-and-reviewing-each-other}

Assessment is critical to progress: What can we do better? What are our growth areas? How can we better leverage our strengths to succeed? What should we invest in for our learning and development? While we should routinely practice self-assessments, it’s also important to receive external assessments from both our supervisors and supervisees.

Providing honest assessments in academia, however, can be difficult, given asymmetric power structures, which can discourage candid feedback, undermine collaborations, and stifle innovation. While I try to create a lab culture that empowers each student with an active voice and provides an open environment for discussion, disagreement, and moment-to-moment feedback, there needs to also be institutional feedback channels to help mitigate or overcome power structures.

In the Makeability Lab and Allen School, there are three semi-formal channels for assessment and feedback: (1) the Allen School [“Annual Review of Progress”](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/handbook/progress-review); (2) the Allen School [“Anonymous Feedback Tool”](https://feedback.cs.washington.edu/), which allows you to provide constructive feedback and report problems anonymously; (3) and the Makeability Lab [“Anonymous Feedback Form”](https://forms.gle/bS4oqmEkhABBP9gT8). Additionally, I would hope that you could discuss any problems, however small, with me during our 1:1s, via email, or ad hoc meetings. The best feedback is timely feedback. Let’s help each other be better\!

## **Allen School Review of Progress** {#allen-school-review-of-progress}

The Allen School has an [“Annual Review of Progress”](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/handbook/progress-review) for each graduate student, which includes a self-assessment and faculty advisor assessment—part of your response is viewable by me and part of it is confidential (these parts are clearly distinguished). This review is an opportunity for us to mutually assess goals, progress, and general satisfaction with each other, the department, and your research. Your responses are reviewed by a “Review of Progress Committee” and the Allen School will intervene if a problem is identified (on either side, student or faculty). 

### *The Student Form* {#the-student-form}

The student form has a self-assessment (you assess yourself) and an advisor assessment (you assess me\!). It’s broken into four major sections: (1) *General Progress and Goals*; (2) *Research*; (3) *Other*; and (4) *Confidential Questions*. I suggest reading the questions carefully as they may help you think through the PhD experience and what attributes the Allen School deems relevant to your success.

1. **General Progress and Goals**  
   1. What are your goals for the next year?  
   2. What are your long-term career goals?  
   3. Name one thing we (advisor or Allen School) can do better to help you reach these goals?  
   4. When do you plan to complete your next milestone (*e.g.,* quals, general exam, defense)?  
   5. In reviewing your goals for this past year, how did your accomplishments measure up to your planned goals?  
2. **Research**  
   1. How often do you meet with your advisor?  
   2. Do you participate in a regularly scheduled lab meeting?  
   3. Briefly describe what you feel are your most important research or academic accomplishments in the past year.  
   4. Do you feel that your advisor is helping you grow into an independent researcher?  
   5. Give a short description of your current research project.  
      1. On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), how excited about it are you?  
      2. On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), how excited about it do you think your advisor is?  
      3. Name one additional form of advising or other support you could receive that would benefit you on this project.  
   6. Over the past year, have you worked on any projects that you did not find particularly interesting? If so, briefly describe the circumstances surrounding these projects.  
3. **Other**  
   1. What sources of financial support do you anticipate receiving for the next academic year?  
   2. Please describe any non-research activities you have participated over the last year (*e.g.,* departmental service, TAing, mentoring, internships)  
4. **Confidential Questions** (only visible to the Grad Advising Staff, Associate Director of Graduate Programs, and the Review of Progress Committee Chair)  
   1. Please explain any circumstances which may have impeded your progress this year.  
   2. Are you getting the advising or co-advising you need? If not, what are you not getting?  
   3. Is there anything you would like the Review of Progress Committee to take up on your behalf regarding the department or any member of the department?  
5. **Optional Questions**   
   1. Feedback to your advisor(s) that will be passed along verbatim but without your name attached to a committee of senior faculty responsible for the next review of your advisor. Any feedback will be anonymized.  
   2. Recommendations or suggestions for improving the Annual Review Process

### *The Faculty Form* {#the-faculty-form}

In addition to the student-filled form described above, the Annual Review of Progress also has a faculty review form for each student, which I attempt to carefully and diligently fill out. Typically, I’m asked to perform my review after you’ve completed your self-assessment, so I can see your responses (as necessary) to inform my views. Here are the current questions (as of 2021):

1. How would you assess the student’s progress in the program? (This is a closed-form question with five options: Unsatisfactory, Requiring Improvement, Meeting Expectations, Exceeding Expectations, Exceptional)  
2. Explain your overall assessment.  
3. When will the student complete their next milestone (Quals, Generals, Final Exam)?  
4. Is there anything you wish the Review of Progress Committee to pursue with the student?  
5. Please use the space below to provide a message that is viewable by the student. (This is where I take time to carefully reflect on and describe your progress for the year; I always try to highlight strengths and accomplishments as well as areas of improvement).

## **Annual review letter to me** {#annual-review-letter-to-me}

In addition to the official [Allen School Annual Review of Progress](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/handbook/progress-review), I kindly request that PhD students  (and postdoc, research scientist members(You could also include ugrad and MS students but I believe this would constitute a different letter as they have different amounts of interactions with and needs from me.)) work together to co-author an annual review letter for me. Notably, this is different from the official progress review in that I expect you to work collaboratively to think about, discuss, and write about my strengths and improvement areas. We all have both. And I want to hear from you.

In Spring’20, I asked for and received a co-written letter from Makeability Lab PhD students, which identified both key strengths and improvement areas in my advising(In fact, this handbook was partially inspired by the feedback I received\!). The students mentioned the following strengths (lightly edited):

* Deeply passionate, enthusiastic, and strong drive towards work. Makes us feel like we want to work on our project when we are low.  
* Gives deep, comprehensive, and concrete feedback  
* Makes a lot of time for students and is generally very available  
* Supportive of discussing personal and professional issues  
* Cares about our well being and supports us outside the group  
* Positive outlook towards work

I was also grateful for more constructive feedback on how I could improve, including working with each individual student to define milestones and success together, delegating more project management responsibilities to the lead PhD (greater sense of autonomy), ensuring that all students feel “safe to fail”, and ensuring that feedback is delivered constructively.

For consistency, I would like to request this letter during the Spring quarter.
