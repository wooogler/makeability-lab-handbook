The Makeability Lab is proudly part of the broader Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community at UW‚Äîone of the top HCI research institutions in the world (across almost any measure, from consistently publishing the most papers at CHI (*e.g.,* [2019](https://www.kashyaptodi.com/chi2019/institutions), 2020\) to its strong track record of top [paper awards](https://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards/#chi) at CHI, ASSETS, UIST, and Vis, to achieving field-wide recognitions like SIGCHI Academy and [Social Impact Awards](https://sigchi.org/awards/)), with leading scholars in nearly every subdiscipline from accessibility and health informatics to social computing and disinformation. UW is also one of the largest and most intellectually diverse HCI/design communities: 50+ faculty and 150 students across the [Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), [HCDE](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/), the [iSchool](https://ischool.uw.edu/), [Art+Design](https://art.washington.edu/), [Communication](https://com.uw.edu/), and less prevalently, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Medicine, and more. You can and should leverage this enormous pool of people and expertise: take classes, seek or spur cross-disciplinary collaborations, get to know this amazing community\! 

## **DUB and DUB Seminar** {#dub-and-dub-seminar}

Because UW HCI is so large and spread across departments, [DUB](https://dub.washington.edu/) was created to bring all-things-HCI together on campus. We meet once a week for [DUB Seminar](https://dub.washington.edu/seminar.html) (virtual during COVID) and host an annual retreat in the fall. DUB also hosts various social activities at conferences.

If you‚Äôre at UW and interested in HCI and/or a Makeability Lab member, you should sign up for the DUB mailing list and DUB Slack. See DUB‚Äôs [‚ÄúGetting Involved‚Äù page](https://dub.washington.edu/gettinginvolved.html).

## **HCI PhD Programs at UW** {#hci-phd-programs-at-uw}

DUB is not a degree granting institution. Instead, you can apply for and pursue an HCI PhD within one of our constituent UW schools or departments. Most commonly, this would be in the [Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), [HCDE](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/), the [iSchool](https://ischool.uw.edu/), or [Communication](https://com.uw.edu/)‚Äîeach department has their own application process, coursework requirements, and unique culture. There is also a strong culture of cross-departmental advising.

If you‚Äôre considering applying for a PhD in HCI at UW, please carefully investigate potential departments, research groups, and advisors.

## **HCI-Related Masters Programs at UW** {#hci-related-masters-programs-at-uw}

In addition to PhDs, UW offers a variety of HCI-related terminal(Terminal because  they are not intended to feed into PhD programs; they are an end result themselves\! üéâüéäüéà) MS programs, each with their own flavor, foci, constraints, and opportunities. Typically, students in these programs do not have time for academic research although some may choose to engage via independent studies or [Directed Research Groups](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/directed). Indeed, we have had some success in working with and benefiting from these students in our research (see our [alumni list](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/))‚Äîthey are time constrained but incredibly talented and creative.

The MHCI+D website provides a [helpful comparison tool](https://mhcid.washington.edu/related-degrees/) between HCI MS programs. Others have written their [own reflections](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-main-difference-between-these-two-programs-at-University-of-Washington-Human-Computer-Interaction-and-Design-vs-Human-Centered-Design-and-Engineering) about differences. 

* [**Master of HCI and Design at University of Washington (MHCI+D)**](https://mhcid.washington.edu/)**.** A one year, cohort-based MS program with a studio-learning model. Students attend full time. I have served on the MHCI+D Executive Committee for multiple years, taught HCID521 Prototyping Studio, and was the Faculty Chair from 2021-2024.  
* [**Master of Science in Human Centered Design & Engineering (MS HCDE)**](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/ms)**.** A two-year MS program with a flexible schedule to enable industry professionals to attend.  
* [**iSchool Master of Science in Information Management (MIM)**](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/msim)**.** Offers both one- and two-year programs depending on relevant professional experience and career goals with specialization tracks in areas like data science, user experience, and information architecture.  
* [**Master of Design (MDes).**](https://art.washington.edu/design/design-mdes) A two-year, terminal-degree program aimed at artists/designers who are interested in pursuing academic careers or deepening their practice by engaging in advanced research and scholarship.

## **Industry Partnerships** {#industry-partnerships}

UW HCI also benefits from the vibrant technology industry and startup culture in the Seattle area. UWers frequently collaborate with industry partners at Google, Facebook, AI2, Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, and beyond‚Äîall partially enabled and sustained by close proximity. Such industry presence in Seattle also makes it easy to do off-cycle internships or to take a class led by an industry expert.

## **Temporary advising** {#temporary-advising}

When you start as an Allen School PhD student, you will be assigned a temporary advisor. This assignment is based on your specific preferences (a form you fill out), load balancing amongst faculty, and alignment with faculty interests. As the Allen School [temporary advisor guide](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/newgrad/advisors) outlines, the temporary advisor has administrative, research, and mentoring roles‚Äîall in *support* of you. What classes to take and when? How to pursue research and with who? How is the transition going to graduate school? In many cases, temporary advisors become permanent advisors but sometimes not. If you‚Äôre an Allen School PhD student, the faculty care most about finding the best fit for *you* in our PhD program and will help you think about short-term and long-term advising.

## **Choosing a research group/advisor** {#choosing-a-research-group/advisor}

If you‚Äôre a prospective PhD student or, perhaps, already at UW and thinking about joining the Makeability Lab, I hope this handbook is useful in learning about our group, my advising style, and mutual expectations. Please read it carefully and feel free to ask me questions.

Additionally, I wanted to share other resources about selecting PhD advisors since it‚Äôs one of the most important factors in your PhD experience.(I would say the other two critical factors are your peer group (who are your fellow PhD students and what are they like) and the number of faculty in your area at your university (*e.g.,* in case you need to shift advisors or want to work on larger collaborative projects).) You can use these resources as a guide when applying to graduate programs, attending visit days, and ultimately deciding on a PhD program.

See also this [helpful poster version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2ZTrUQYDXKbMlcmSH8lE-MW5vOX77PR/view) and two relevant Twitter threads ([thread1](https://twitter.com/mldcmu/status/1234494649877790726), [thread2](https://twitter.com/andrewkuznet/status/1102631559432159232)). 

To add to the above, I suggest seeking out current and former students of a lab for their honest thoughts‚Äîboth those that graduated and those that did not as well as those that left to a different group. 

From my website logs, I have realized that a fair amount of inbound traffic comes from [csrankings.org](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us). I would like to caution prospective students in using this website for assessing and analyzing interdisciplinary researchers in fields like HCI and accessibility. For a rationale, please see this article by Professor Mark Guzdial:

* [Why I Don‚Äôt Recommend CSRankings.org: Know the Values You Are Ranking On](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/248078-why-i-dont-recommend-csrankingsorg-know-the-values-you-are-ranking-on/fulltext), Mark Guzdial, Communications of the ACM.

Moreover, much of our research involves large, collaborative projects with complex system building+evaluation. CSRankings diminishes these contributions by computing a weighted score for each paper that divides by the number of co-authors.
