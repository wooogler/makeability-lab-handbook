# **What do I (Jon) do?** {#what-do-i-(jon)-do?}

Like all tenure-track faculty, my job is split between three primary roles: research, teaching, and service(When I first interviewed at [R1 research institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States) for tenure-track faculty positions in 2011, I heard a variety of messages about faculty workload. Most indicated or even explicitly stated that research was my primary responsibility and offered suggested allocations of \~70% research, 30% teaching, and 10% service (yes, this intentionally adds up above 100%). Now that I am tenured faculty, I feel more freedom in how I spend my time and have taken more service leadership roles; however, note that each of these three core responsibilities can be all-consuming and require careful time management. There is an informative graphic on \#academictwitter about the multi-faceted roles of faculty positions ([link](https://twitter.com/lindatropp/status/1410220523276152839?s=20)).)—each which could be full-time jobs in their own right. To provide greater insight into my everyday work life, I briefly cover all three below.

## **Research** {#research}

My research time is largely spent on envisionment, fundraising, project management, mentorship, reading literature, writing (both papers and proposals), and providing feedback and guidance to students. I treasure time when I can actually code or build things  (*e.g.,* like [analysis scripts](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/accessibility-literature-survey) or [Project Sidewalk dev](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk)) but these moments are rare. Typically, the “on-the-ground” research is conducted by you—building systems, running interview protocols, performing data analysis—all with my feedback and support. 

I look forward to collaborating closely with you on your research from ideation and design mocks to study planning, analysis, and writing. Throughout, we should have strong communication and tight feedback loops. For example, I expect weekly status update emails—in the form of a Google Doc or Slide deck, for example—accompanied with our weekly 1:1s and active participation in our lab and project meetings. You can expect that I will carefully review and comment on artifacts you share with me (*e.g.,* draft study protocols, design mocks). I prefer *more* communication to *less*. Do not hesitate to reach out.

## **Teaching** {#teaching}

“*If you want to master something, teach it.*” \-Richard Feyman(I could not find a solid source [for this quote](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1431128121898528771?s=20). If you have one, please share it with me.)

Teaching is a privilege and one of the most impactful things I do in my professorial life both “in the classroom” and via advising and mentorship. Teaching is also part of your PhD journey—both informally as you mentor and support your peers as well as junior students and more formally as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in undergrad and graduate courses. 

The more I teach classes, the more I understand and appreciate the synergistic link to research. It helps me think. It helps me learn. It forces me to dive deeply into a subject, organize topics thematically, and stay abreast of the most recent technology developments and research. Every time I teach a course, I learn new things—not just about the course topic but about how to be a better instructor and how to improve my curriculum. 

### *My Teaching Load* {#my-teaching-load}

Allen School faculty appointments require teaching three courses per year; however, many faculty only teach twice/year. How come? Because of teaching releases. Faculty members can achieve releases either by “buying out” (using research funds to pay the department so we can focus on research that quarter) or via university service (*e.g.,* appointments with heavy workloads like an Associate Dean in the College or Director position within the Allen School).

## **Service** {#service}

Service is not only critical to sustaining community and scientific practice but also provides many professional benefits: it expands your professional network, provides opportunities to develop new skills, and allows you to work with and learn from other people. One of my favorite parts of service is the opportunity to work on new, meaningful challenges and meet and work with new people.

In a [later section](#service-1), I highlight potential service opportunities for you as a PhD student. For my academic service, I typically focus on giving back to my research community, my department, and/or my university. This may come in many forms from reviewing papers to leading Allen School initiatives to serving on organizational or editorial committees for conferences or journals. For example, in 2021-22, I am in the following service roles:

* Faculty Chair of [MHCI+D](https://mhcid.washington.edu/) and on the MHCI+D admissions committee  
* Allen School Faculty Undergraduate Program Coordinator and on the ugrad admissions committee  
* Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/)  
* Posters/Demo Co-Chair of [ASSETS’21](https://assets21.sigaccess.org/)  
* General Chair of [ASSETS’22](https://assets22.sigaccess.org/)

I also routinely review for the top conferences and journals in our field, including CHI, ASSETS, IMWUT, UIST, and TACCESS. For several years, I was an Associate Editor of IMWUT.
