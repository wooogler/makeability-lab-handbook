# Preparing and presenting posters {#preparing-and-presenting-posters}
![][image27]**Figure.** An example research poster fair (at the Transportation Research Board conference in Washington DC). How will you make your research poster stand out? What will make someone stop at your poster to learn more?
With a research poster, you have roughly 36”x60” to capture your viewer’s attention and communicate your research. My view is that the research poster is an **advertisement for your paper,** an advertisement for you (yes, you! And the team!), and should be designed as a **visual aid** **complement** to you standing there and communicating your research. Some tips:
- Make the title big, bold, attractive. Consider asking a question. The title should be readable from 15-30 feet away.
- Use visuals to communicate your story complemented by very little text.
- If you must use text, avoid prose. Use bullets.
- Remember, your poster will often be in a hall with ~100-200 other posters. How will you grab your viewers attention? As a passerby walks by, what will make them stop? If you have a wall of text, they will just move right along. See figure above.
## Good and Bad Poster Designs {#good-and-bad-poster-designs}
![][image28]**Figure.** A famous poster redesign by Michigan State University doctoral student Mike Morrison. Image from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/11/729314248/to-save-the-science-poster-researchers-want-to-kill-it-and-start-over?t=1575482924723). Notice how it draws you in from afar. And then once you walk close, you can read a bullet-pointed overview augmented by visuals.
Here is but a small selection of some of my favorite posters from the Makeability Lab:

| [BodyVis poster](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ahbbp4mo486b0iev6f9kj/2013-Norooz-BodyVis-SilverSpringMiniMakerFaire-Poster.pdf?rlkey=bfca3l28lq0ecsoe0eap8aiur&dl=0) by UMD MS student Leyla Norooz (great use of graphics & colors; however, fonts are too thin and insufficient contrast with text colors and background) | [Ondule poster](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yguays7swyal27jap340u/2017-Liang-UIST-Ondule_Poster.pdf?rlkey=a8073fd8goqu3a9kuzijp2zmk&dl=0) by UW PhD student Liang He (again, great use of graphics, clearly communicates research, maybe a bit visually busy) | [Social Fabric Fitness poster](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vgb57rian7lmase6b4q2t/2014-Mauriello-CHI-SocialFabricFitness-Poster.pdf?rlkey=l5bjia4x9x83dyn3px1c0pkgs&dl=0) by Jon E. Froehlich (in retrospect, too much text; should have eliminated 80% of the text and bullet pointed but the poster does draw you in with the graphic and question) |
In contrast, here is a poorly designed research poster: text heavy, no clear reading direction, boring.

## What tools to use? {#what-tools-to-use?}
I tend to make my posters in PowerPoint (go into the Design tab and set the *Slide Size* to *Custom Slide Size* of whatever your dimensions are—for example, 34” x 56”). Note that PowerPoint limits their max slide size to 56” x 56”.
Others use Adobe Illustrator (*e.g.,* [FuzzPrint](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jqepwf96yk5z0xms2x3fj/2017-Liang-CSE599-FuzzPrint-Poster.ai?rlkey=z5vqjet479z6iivku2adft5xt&dl=0)), Photoshop (*e.g.,* [TacTILE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jt74y0ayxuj9w94venkff/2017-Liang-ASSETS-TacTile-Poster.psd?rlkey=5dyzfjcef5wfsbl0v3jnuttkz&dl=0)), or Figma (*e.g.,* [BusStopCV](https://www.figma.com/design/8H1qbX1DjwG9vmL0yT5RST/Streetscape-CV---Figures?node-id=262-309), [Sidewalk Equity](https://www.figma.com/design/i2oFnuVE4wEdDfEwQbwil2/PacTransPoster?node-id=49-1125))
## Where to print a poster? {#where-to-print-a-poster?}
In the Allen School, we are fortunate to have a poster printer! You can learn more about using it [here](https://www.cs.washington.edu/lab/printing/poster-printer). This is useful for Affiliates Day and other on-campus events. For a conference that requires travel, you can print a poster in the Allen School and travel with it using a carrying tube. Or, you can print the poster at your destination (if you know a poster printer is available).
