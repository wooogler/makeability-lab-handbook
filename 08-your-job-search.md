# Your Job Search {#your-job-search}
In your last year of graduate school, you will perform a “job search”—which will differ depending on what kind of position you seek: tenure-track faculty, teaching faculty, industry research, engineering, startup, *etc.* Although this formally happens in your Nth year, your job search culminates all of your prior experiences and builds off of the research connections, collaborations, and networks. If you’re interested in academia, I recommend [Professor Evan Peck’s article](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) on the nuances and opportunities across different types of universities.

### Example Tenure-Track Job Packets {#example-tenure-track-job-packets}
Below, we provide publicly available job packets, which were collectively added by Makeability Lab members. While the job market is ever changing and has new types of emphases and requirements (*e.g.,* diversity statements), I am including my packet from 2010 in case it’s useful. If the following links go down, you can use [https://archive.org/](https://archive.org/) to find them (simply copy/paste the original url into Archive’s Wayback Machine prompt)

## Academic Job Talks {#academic-job-talks}
Job talks are a unique type of talk: you have 45-50 minutes to describe your PhD research, its contributions and (potential for) impact, and to demonstrate your mastery of complex material and your ability to explain it either to a broad audience of students, staff, and faculty. Unlike conference talks, which are often attended by members within the same or similar discipline (*e.g.,* HCI, ubicomp), job talks are attended by entire departments across all sub-disciplines (*e.g.,* theory, machine learning, systems). Job talks are used not just to evaluate your research but your ability to explain it and, for better or worse, your potential as a teacher.
As with other parts of your job package, I am happy to work with you on your job talk. I would estimate that producing a high-quality job talk takes ~1.5-2 weeks, including initial outlining, drafting slides, giving practice talks, iterating, and giving more practice talks. To save some effort, you should be able to reuse previous slides from conference talks, dissertation proposal, *etc.* But know that a job talk is fundamentally different, so be careful to select the appropriate level of detail.
### Example Job Talks {#example-job-talks}
To learn how to give a good job talk, it’s helpful to study examples—both the good and the bad.
As one helpful resource, the Allen School maintains an [archive](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia/search) of all previous job talks dating back to 1996; however, they are not clearly marked as job talks and instead, are generically called colloquium talks. Moreover, not every talk includes a publicly accessible video. Still, if you know when a HCI scholar entered the job market, you may be able to find their Allen School job talk in the [archive](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia/search). Other universities have similar archives or feeds of prior talks. And you might be able to find job talks on YouTube. So, start sleuthing and studying what makes for a good job talk!
Here are some helpful examples. Talks are in reverse chronological order:
- TODO: it would be really great to highlight some other excellent job talks here, let me know if you have some.
- [**Stefanie Mueller**, Interacting with Personal Fabrication Machines](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia/search/details?id=2845), Feb 25, 2016. Stefanie was a PhD student at Hasso Plattner institute in Germany and is now a professor at MIT.
- [**Chris Harrison**, Interacting with Small Devices in Big Ways, Allen School Talk,](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia/search/details?id=1318) Mar 7, 2013. Chris was a PhD student at CMU and his job search took him back to CMU as a professor.
- [**Michael Bernstein**, Crowd-Powered Systems, Allen School Talk](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia/search/details?id=1172), Feb 28, 2012. Michael was a PhD student at MIT and his job search resulted in a Stanford professorship.
### My Job Talks {#my-job-talks}
I’ve prepared and given two sets of job talks: the first, for my original job search as a PhD student in 2010-2011, which resulted in my CS professorship at UMD and, second, for my job talk to return to UW as a professor in 2016-2017(This was a constrained search. We only applied to UW and were quite happy with our professorships at UMD but missed living on the west coast and being close to family.). These are two vastly different types of talks: one is from a student and the other is from a late-stage assistant professor.
- My original job talk from 2011 entitled *Sensing & Feedback of Everyday Activities to Promote Environmentally Sustainable Behaviors*. Here are the slides ([PPTX](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/talks/Sensing_and_Feedback_of_Everyday_Activities_to_Promote_Environmentally_Sustainable_Behaviors_oMTV0bC.pptx), [PDF](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/talks/Froehlich_SensingAndFeedbackToPromoteEnvironmentallySustainableBehaviors_VirginiaTechSeminar2012_Z4o4uFa.pdf)). I was fortunate to present the talk ~16-20 times. Here’s a [video from Columbia University](https://youtu.be/PZxtoy16mS4) and [another from the University of Michigan](https://youtu.be/yiBN4iu7hOk). For the latter, my laptop crashed (also, their screen recorder did not properly capture my slides).
- My UW job talk entitled *Making with a Social Purpose* ([video](https://youtu.be/c79axOoeRIs), [PPTX](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/talks/Froehlich_OverviewTalk_v3.5-PostTalkEdits.pptx), [PDF](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/talks/Froehlich_MakingWithASocialPurpose_2016.pdf)) from 2017.
