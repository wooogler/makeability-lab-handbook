# Makeability Lab Resources {#makeability-lab-resources}
As lab PI, I want to provide you with the resources and equipment necessary to do your research, fulfill your potential, and be successful. If you need something, please ask. I will work with you on a solution.
## Communication {#communication}
We primarily use Slack and email for communication:
- **Mailing me.** If something is important and you want me to add it to my work queue (*e.g.,* give feedback on a design mock, review a paper draft), please email me at [jonf@cs.uw.edu](mailto:jonf@cs.uw.edu). You can also ping me on the Makeability Lab Slack. It’s best to include a deadline so I can prioritize when to provide feedback. Please follow-up if you do not hear back. I don’t mind!
- **Mailing lists.** We have multiple Makeability Lab mailing lists. For current PhD students, I will often email announcements or forward opportunities to [makeabilitylab-grad@cs.uw.edu](mailto:makeabilitylab-grad@cs.uw.edu). We also have a general [makeabilitylab@cs.uw.edu](mailto:makeabilitylab@cs.uw.edu) that goes to all active students (high school, ugrad, grad) and [makeabilitylab-alumni@cs.uw.edu](mailto:makeabilitylab-alumni@cs.uw.edu).
- **Slack.** For synchronous communication and more informal chats, we use Slack: [https://makeabilitylab.slack.com](https://makeabilitylab.slack.com/). If you’re on the Project Sidewalk team, please join both the Makeability Lab Slack and the Project Sidewalk Slack: [https://projectsidewalk.slack.com](https://projectsidewalk.slack.com).
- **Twitter.** Our lab maintains two Twitter accounts: [@makeabilitylab](https://twitter.com/makeabilitylab) and [@projsidewalk](https://twitter.com/projsidewalk). Jon is at [@jonfroehlich](https://twitter.com/jonfroehlich).
- **Makeability Lab website.** We post all projects and papers to the [Makeability Lab website](#lab-website). When you join the lab, you should get added to the lab website.
## Lab Space {#lab-space}
The Allen School is privileged with lab space, which brings choice and opportunity. Ideally, to build rapport between us, we would all work in the same lab space. I realize, however, that preferences and needs differ. For example, some of us work with hardware, others do not.
There are two hardware/fabrication lab spaces. You need to sign up for training to use this equipment. Email [Alexander Lefort](mailto:aalefort@cs.washington.edu) and sign up for the [fablab mailing list](https://mailman.cs.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/fablab).
- The **Ubiquitous Computing Lab (Ubicomp Lab)** in the Allen Center (CSE 605 & 615). I moved my office to CSE642 specifically to be close to the UbiComp Lab. My preference is that you use this as your primary lab space given its proximity to my office and the opportunity to intermix with [UbiComp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) students.
- The **FabLab** in the Gates Center (CSE2 G15)
And two HCI lab spaces:
- The **HCI Lab** in the Allen Center (CSE 591)
- The **HCI Lab** in the Gates Center (CSE2 283)
### Lab Access {#lab-access}
To request lab access, send an email to [cardkey@cs.washington.edu](mailto:cardkey@cs.washington.edu) and CC me with the specific location (e.g., UbiComp Lab in CSE605) with a specific date range.
### HCI/UbiComp Lab Spaces {#hci/ubicomp-lab-spaces}
#### The Ubicomp Lab (CSE 605) {#the-ubicomp-lab-(cse-605)}
#### ![A collage of photos of CSE 605 and CSE 615. This image contains two rows of photos. The upper row shows four pictures of the room CSE 605 where graduate students sit. The second row shows five photos of the workshop room (CSE 615), including equipment such as 3D printers and laser cutters and workbenches.][image14] Figure. Pictures of the Ubicomp Lab workspace (CSE605) and neighboring fabrication space (CSE615). You can access CSE615 via CSE605.
The UbiComp Lab (CSE 605) has 21 assigned seats for research assistants and a connected fab lab (CSE 615) with 3D printers (*e.g,* Stratasys F370, F120, Form 3, and Ultimaker 3), laser cutters (*e.g.,* Glowforge), a reflow oven (LPKF ProtoFlow S), and soldering stations.
- To request a seat, please email me so I can work with Shwetak on lab assignments ([the seat chart is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UUThYXuY6JO0E-Qzcfw2uTfiYEIs68ELPVF-QbUrdc/edit#gid=0)).
- To request keycard access to the fab lab side (CSE615), please email [cardkey@cs.washington.edu](mailto:cardkey@cs.washington.edu) and CC me
#### The FabLab (CSE2 G15) {#the-fablab-(cse2-g15)}
![This picture shows a collection of equipment in the FabLab.][image15]Figure. Pictures of the FabLab in CSE2 (G15). You need training to use these spaces and some equipment requires additional training.
The FabLab (CSE2 G15) is not intended as a fulltime workspace but rather a place to drop in for specialized fabrication projects. Besides three desktop 3D printers (2 Ultimaker 3 extended and 1 Form 3) and a laser cutter (Glowforge), this lab offers more advanced equipment options. To name a few (see figure below): knitting machine Shima Seiki SWG091N2, Stratasys-FDM 3D printers F170/f120, Desktop Metal 3D Studio printer, Stratasys Objet 30 polyjet 3D printer, Trotec Speedy 300 laser cutter,  LPKF Protolaser S4 PCB laser cutter, ShopBot PRS-Alpha CNC router, Drill Press Powermatic PM2800B, and Tablesaw Sawstop JSS Pro. Please check the full list of equipment on [the official website of FabLab](https://fablab.cs.washington.edu/machines/). To use this equipment, please reach out to the lab manager Alexander Lefort ([aalefort@cs.washington.edu](mailto:aalefort@cs.washington.edu)) for training first.
![This picture shows a collection of equipment in the FabLab.][image16]Figure. Pictures of the FabLab equipment in CSE2 (G15).

![This pictures shows the seats and shared discussion area in the HCI lab located in room 591 at the Allen Center.][image17]Figure. A picture of the Allen Center HCI Lab (CSE591) with ideation spaces and a few desks for working..
The Allen Center HCI Lab (CSE 591) provides a casual and collaborative ideation space with a whiteboard, projection screen, and couches as well as eight desks for graduate students and postdocs. Currently, the lab is mostly inhabited by Professor Reinecke and Fogarty’s students.
#### Gates Center HCI Lab (CSE2 283) {#gates-center-hci-lab-(cse2-283)}
![A picture of the space with a hardware workshop, ideation spaces, and a few desks for working][image18]Figure. A picture of the Gates Center HCI Lab (CSE2 283) with a hardware workshop, ideation spaces, and a few desks for working.
The Gates Center HCI Lab (CSE2 283) provides a casual and collaborative ideation space with a large whiteboard, a mini-workshop for tinkering on hardware projects, and couches as well as six desks for graduate students. Currently, the lab is mostly inhabited by Professor Mankoff’s students.
## Equipment and Software {#equipment-and-software}
By far, the most expensive lab costs are not equipment but people (as it should be!). Thus, from a raw productivity point-of-view, it only makes sense to supply you with the equipment you need to be successful. As my father always says, “*invest in the right tool for the job.*” Perhaps the most critical equipment resource is a laptop, discussed below. But we are happy to support you with other equipment if it’s necessary for your research (and we have the budget).
### Software {#software}
Most software that we commonly use in the lab is free: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and Google Drive.
We write most of our papers in Microsoft Word and Overleaf. You can get Office 365 (*e.g.,* Word, PowerPoint) through UW for free ([link](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/software-computers/productivity-platforms/microsoft-productivity-platform/)). For Overleaf, please remember to start your projects with your cs.uw.edu accounts as the Allen School provides a professional account for all of us ([link](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/uw)). Note that you may need to email support@cs to make sure you are appropriately added to the “CSE Group” for Overleaf. If not, you may not get Overleaf pro account features. Please ask on Slack #activegrads or #general if you’re confused.
For UI mockups and figure making for papers, students prefer [Figma](https://figma.com/) or Adobe Creative Suite. Unfortunately, the latter is expensive. If you only need to use Adobe tools infrequently—*e.g.,* to make a PDF accessible—then you can use the Adobe Creative Cloud machine in CSE622, which is a shared resource.

### Laptops {#laptops}
When you arrive as a first-year PhD student, the Allen School will provide you with a new, high-performance laptop. You will receive an email from the Allen School IT staff with options. In Fall’23, for example, this included either:
- **Mac Laptop (MacOS):** Macbook Pro 13", M2 chip with 8-core CPU and 19-core GPU ARM architecture, 16GB ram, 256GB SSD, webcam, bluetooth, 2560x1600, 3yr AppleCare+ for Schools warranty, Color: space gray. (As a comparison, in Fall’21, we offered a Macbook Pro 13", M1 chip w/8-core CPU & 8-core GPU ARM architecture, 16GB ram, 256GB SSD)
- **Lightweight PC Laptop (Win10/Linux):** Dell Latitude 5430, 14",12th gen, i7-1265U 3.60GHz (turbo to 4.8GHz), 32GB ram, 512GB SSD, webcam, bluetooth, 1920x1080 Intel Iris Xe graphics, 3yr warranty. (As a comparison, in Fall’21, we offered a Dell Latitude 5420, 14", 11th gen i7-1185G7 4C 4.0GHz (turbo to 4.8GHz), 16GB ram, 256GB SSD)
You also have the option of receiving $1500 credit towards an “off-menu” choice and working with your PhD advisor (me) towards the purchase of an alternative. Please choose a device that works for you. If you’ve recently invested in a laptop, it may be worthwhile deferring for a year.
As you progress through the PhD program, it may be necessary to refresh your laptop. Again, I am happy to work with you on this via a case-by-case basis.
### Other Hardware {#other-hardware}
From Arduinos to AR Glasses, we are happy to support you with the equipment you need for your research. We also have equipment to share or borrow, which we track [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcGdYMZGkV-_Yc1L2qZhdzOlP71nvI7FrsVtdBFtam4/edit#gid=0). Before ordering new equipment, please clear it with me.
### Hyak
For machine learning experiments, we also have a Hyak node. PhD student, Jared Hwang, has [written up Hyak documentation for our lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJDKlZqjmgSloOOrXLbGLvTlA136suVYVDJdvGyjxHk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2nsyqt83uxrn) and helps run the #hyak-use channel on the ML Slack.
### Laptops for UGrads {#laptops-for-ugrads}
We often have a handful of laptops that we can lend to our ugrad RAs or visiting researchers. Check the [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcGdYMZGkV-_Yc1L2qZhdzOlP71nvI7FrsVtdBFtam4/edit#gid=0). The [accounts and passwords are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOwHdb1LJ4O5EooHoY_R0MzDalpUzkmnnQWdRBXjaK8/edit).
## Lab Website {#lab-website}
Our lab website is at [https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) and is built in Django (Python). All code is open source and available on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/makeabilitylabwebsite)). We currently have over 100 open issues. If you like web development and/or have Django experience, we would greatly appreciate your help. 🙏
If you are a grad student or research scientist in our lab, you should:
- Make [project pages](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/projects)
- Add in [news](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/news/)
- Add your [publications](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/publications/)
You can use the gradmin account (Slack us for the password). Xia Su is currently our lab website manager. He can help you!
## Lab Photos {#lab-photos}
Our lab history and time together is captured (in part) by our collection of photos and videos stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147mn1qd-Bw6duTxwjugnGQ0mwLg8zsYT?usp=sharing) (this is a private link for Makeability Lab members only).
## Lab GitHub {#lab-github}
We use GitHub religiously for hosting and coordinating our research projects. Your code can begin in a private repo but should be released on the [Makeability Lab organization](https://github.com/makeabilitylab) for research publication. One exception is Project Sidewalk, which exists [as its own GitHub organization](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk).
Kind reminder: you should *never* write research code without continuously backing it up (ideally, using a version control system like Git) but, in the worst case, Dropbox, GDrive, Box, iCloud, *etc.*
## Lab Logos {#lab-logos}
Here are links to logos for the [Makeability Lab](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ol8u5o8sy4tw89g/AACTn2B61RVXYKs3zh4yWioJa?dl=0), the [Allen School and UW](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iwdvv1ypc72avuu/AAAIk3lzWoxLyBkC26GuAEYsa?dl=0), and [UW CREATE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/7o1d2fbebi0kvmh2grcnu/h?rlkey=y9577tst7wfc2c3mz3w5ygeyz&dl=0). The logos for Project Sidewalk are in the [Project Sidewalk Design GitHub repo](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/Design). Logos should be used on the first and last slide. Here are some [ideas/templates](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vfi48v4tma6wzmet77v68/MakeabilityLab-TalkBranding.pptx?rlkey=p38fu8uz23x22zruudpbbppax&dl=0).

## Lab IRB Applications {#lab-irb-applications}
All “human subjects” studies in our lab must be reviewed by [UW’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/) in their Human Subjects Division. As a graduate student, you will lead the preparation of our IRB application with feedback and vetting from me. Fortunately, UW uses an online submission system called [Zipline](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/zipline/).
To assess whether your planned study needs IRB, the UW’s IRB website has a four-step process. See [Do I need IRB Review?](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/do-i-need-irb-review/) If in doubt, talk to me—I’ll probably encourage you to email ([hsdinfo@uw.edu](mailto:hsdinfo@uw.edu)) or call the IRB offices directly.
To help you prepare your own IRB application, please see our [lab archive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PU6bj_m5UPIfmrGOnkwD5JURqsvZyDW2?usp=share_link) (this is a private link for current Makeability Lab members).
## Accessing CSE Linux Servers {#accessing-cse-linux-servers}
The Makeability Lab website, Project Sidewalk, and even your academic website runs on CSE Linux servers. It’s fastest and easiest to setup an SSH key to quickly SSH into these servers.
### Mac/Linux {#mac/linux}
On Mac or Linux, open up the terminal. Run:
> ssh-keygen
Hit <Enter> to accept the defaults (no passphrase needed). The key will be saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Then, again in terminal, run:
> ssh-copy-id user@host
So, for example, I would run
> ssh-copy-id jonf@recycle.cs.washington.edu
Here, you’ll be asked to login for the final time with your password. Once this completes, you should be able to do this:
> ssh jonf@recycle.cs.washington.edu
And it will succeed without having to enter a password.
### Windows {#windows}
On Windows, open up Windows Powershell and type:
> ssh-keygen
Hit <Enter> to accept the defaults (no passphrase needed). The key will be saved in $env:USERPROFILE/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key in $env:USERPROFILE
/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Unlike on Mac/Linux, the command ssh-copy-id does not exist, so to move your key onto the server, you need to do something else:
> type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh {IP-ADDRESS-OR-FQDN} "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
So, in our case, we would type:
> type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh recycle.cs.washington.edu "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
The server recycle.cs.washington.edu will ask you to login one last time with a password. Once you do that, you should be able to login without one.
