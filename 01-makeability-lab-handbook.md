# Makeability Lab Handbook

By [Professor Jon Froehlich](https://jonfroehlich.github.io/) and lab members  
Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering  
University of Washington

Welcome to the [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/)\! ðŸ‘‹ We are so happy that youâ€™re here. Letâ€™s do great things together\!

This handbook is intended to establish lab principles, values, and expectations. When you join our group (woohoo\!), you are expected to read it. If youâ€™re just considering the Makeability Lab, awesome\! This document should help you understand *who* we are and *whether* ofur lab is a good match for your personality and interests. 

The handbook is a working document. We value your comments, suggested edits, and constructive criticisms. As with the lab itself, this handbook is oursâ€”we get to define who we are and what we want to be. This is both a collective opportunity and a collective responsibility. Being part of a lab, pursuing a PhD, and having a healthy advisor-advisee relationship requires significant work and investment. 

If something is unclear, itâ€™s likely confusing to others tooâ€”so, please ask questions and/or suggest edits so we can collectively improve the handbook. 

This handbook is a start and not an endâ€”and hopefully will provoke self-reflection and opportunities for dialogue between us. Please also see our list of [Resources](#mental-health), the [Allen School Graduate Student Handbook](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/handbook), and the [PhD Process webpage](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/process).

Letâ€™s do it\!
