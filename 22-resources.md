(When I first interviewed at [R1 research institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States) for tenure-track faculty positions in 2011, I heard a variety of messages about faculty workload. Most indicated or even explicitly stated that research was my primary responsibility and offered suggested allocations of ~70% research, 30% teaching, and 10% service (yes, this intentionally adds up above 100%). Now that I am tenured faculty, I feel more freedom in how I spend my time and have taken more service leadership roles; however, note that each of these three core responsibilities can be all-consuming and require careful time management. There is an informative graphic on #academictwitter about the multi-faceted roles of faculty positions ([link](https://twitter.com/lindatropp/status/1410220523276152839?s=20)).):  When I first interviewed at [R1 research institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States) for tenure-track faculty positions in 2011, I heard a variety of messages about faculty workload.

(I suppose a third type is an [endowed professorship](https://www.cs.washington.edu/supportcse/faculty), which provides yearly, unrestricted discretionary funds for those with an endowed position. In the Allen School, endowed professorships are initialized at a level of $1m while endowed chairs are funded at $2m. This high initialization level is important as the goal is to make each endowment self-sustaining via investment. Roughly 4% of each fund is available for faculty expenditure each year and the rest is invested in [UW’s Consolidated Endowment Fund](https://finance.uw.edu/treasury/CEF).):  I suppose a third type is an [endowed professorship](https://www.cs.washington.edu/supportcse/faculty), which provides yearly, unrestricted discretionary funds for those with an endowed position.
