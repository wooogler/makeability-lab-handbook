# What do you do? {#what-do-you-do?}
Your responsibilities are similarly multi-faceted—research, coursework, teaching, mentorship, service, internships—but the emphases differ and will shift as you progress through the program.
## Timeline {#timeline}
Every student is different, every timeline is different. However, you must make consistent progress to succeed. To help guide you, the Allen School suggests the following target milestones:
- [Qualifying Evaluation](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/process/quals) or “Quals” after **two full years**, which includes a coursework and a research project requirement. For your quals project, you must prepare an oral presentation open to all members of the department with required attendance by the primary and secondary advisors. All quals talks are scheduled for 90 minutes by default, which includes a 30-40 minute talk, questions from the audience and advisors, and a closed session (if needed); however, the time allocations are up to the PhD student and the advisor.
- [General Exam](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/process/generals) after **three full years or 1.25 years after Quals**, which includes a written research proposal (20 pages max) and a presentation for an examining committee.
- [Final Exam](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/process/dissertation) by the **end of year five**, which includes a completed dissertation and oral defense with an examining committee. In practice, this is often in Year 6.
Here’s a visualization of the Allen School timeline:
![][image11]
To contextualize the above timeline, I’ve enumerated some of my expectations and tips:
- Your first year is one of significant life transition: moving cities, *becoming* a grad student, learning about research, making new friendships, starting new life routines, taking classes. Be kind to yourself. Find a rhythm that works for you.
- If you have a disability and feel comfortable disclosing, please let me know. Together, we can work with [Disability Resources for Students (DRS)](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/) and the [Disability Services Office (DSO)](https://hr.uw.edu/dso/) along with Allen School grad advising to ensure that your needs are being met.
- You should attempt to involve yourself immediately in research with the goal of being a co-author on a paper submission **within your first 9 months**. You will begin learning the flow and process of research and other intangibles, building rapport with fellow students, and developing skills necessary to take on a first-authored paper project for your first summer. Often this experience will lead to new research ideas that could be a PhD topic.
- For your first summer, you could intern or lead a research project. If funding exists, I prefer the latter as it will further enable us to work closely together, allow you to make progress towards quals, and hopefully result in a first-authored submission to a fall deadline, *e.g.,* CHI (in September) or to IMWUT (in November). Read more on [Internships here](#internships).
- You should then generally aim for ~2-3 papers per year; however, your focus should be on quality not quantity(I strongly subscribe to [Professor Gilbert’s prioritization of quality over quantity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11D3kHElzS2HQxTwPqcaTnU5HCJ8WGE5brTXI4KLf4dM/edit#heading=h.ngumzb8wkj6j)). Not all of these papers need to be first-authored.
- Most students will TA at least a few quarters in their first two years as they complete their classes and begin research. The Allen School requires that all PhD students TA at least twice. Read more about [TAing here](#taships).
## Research {#research-1}
According to the [*Oxford English Dictionary*](https://www-oed-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/view/Entry/163432?rskey=TUALks&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid)*,* research is the “*systematic investigation or inquiry aimed at contributing to knowledge of a theory or topic by careful consideration, observation, or study of a subject*.”  But HCI is a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary field with roots in engineering, sociology, cognitive science, and design and has many different study methods, epistemic sub-cultures, and accepted ways to advance knowledge. Consequently, HCI research can feel, well, amorphous. This is particularly true in a research lab like ours, which focuses on cross-disciplinary topics and actively collaborates with domain experts, scientists, and partners in areas outside CS and HCI.
To begin to understand the ways in which we make HCI research contributions, I suggest Professor Wobbrock and Kientz’s treatise on the subject, which distills seven research contribution types in HCI ([Interactions, 2016](http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/interactions-16.pdf)) and a related article by Bødker *et al.* entitled *Nine Questions for HCI Researchers in the Making* ([Interactions, 2016](https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2016/nine-questions-for-hci-researchers-in-the-making)). Because much of our work in the Makeability Lab involves building and evaluating novel systems, I also recommend Professor Fogarty’s workshop paper on *Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research* ([CHI’17 Workshop](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/publications/workshop-chi2017-codeandcontribution.pdf)).
### Picking a topic {#picking-a-topic}
Many first-year students feel pressured or the need to propose research projects. You shouldn’t. Instead, I suggest spending your first year *learning, discovering,* and *absorbing*—seek out experiences that strengthen your skills, immerse you in topics, and provide tangible research opportunities. It is hard to propose a research project worth pursuing; one that is rich, novel, and has the potential of impact—all which require a familiarity with literature and some level of research expertise.
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t *try* to propose topics—I would *love* to hear your ideas. You have something the rest of us don’t: a freshness and inexperienced eye. This may lead to new, unexpected paths! But it does mean you shouldn’t feel the pressure to propose your own, publication-worthy research topic in your first year(The benefit of proposing your own topic may include a feeling of pride, ownership, and greater agency for the project but you also need to balance this with potential cons: the opportunity cost, the potential longevity of the project (where will funding come from?), and advisor interest and expertise.). Alternatively, when you begin graduate school, I suggest joining a pre-existing project or working on something that your advisor suggests then using those experiences to prepare yourself for greater research autonomy as you progress. Graduate school is a growing process!
But how should you go about ideating and selecting a topic?
I recall hearing an interview question [Desney Tan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/desney/) asked candidates at Microsoft Research: “*What are the biggest open challenges in your field?*” and, depending on your answer, a follow-up might be: “*Why aren’t you working on them?*” Such questions may feel intimidatingly heavyweight but I think the essence is to work on what matters and focus on impact. The question, at first, is not *“How do we solve the problem?”* but rather “*Are we working on the right problem*.” As [Professor Igarashi states](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/writings/siggraph.html), “*if you find a good goal, your work is mostly done. If a wrong goal is set, you are destined to fail*.” Though impact is exceedingly hard to predict, if you’re working on important problems, you are more likely to have an impact (and, regardless, you’ll feel more satisfied in your day-to-day work).
### Ideation Strategies {#ideation-strategies}
In Greenberg *et al.’*s [*Sketching User Experiences: The Workbook*](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71185020590001451), the authors enumerate a number of brainstorming and ideation strategies. I’m particularly fond of thinking about the ideation process as a tree where you begin with a problem and brainstorm solutions (see figure below)—as many ideas as possible at first. The tree width corresponds to the breadth and diversity of ideas (attempting to get the right design) and the tree depth corresponds to the iteration of ideas (attempting to get the design right). The ideation and prototyping process is generative: ideas beget other ideas—some of which are derivations, others which are new limbs on the tree. At some point in a research/design process, one must switch from broadening ideas to converging and iterating on top ideas. This process relates to Paul Laseau’s notion of elaboration and reduction in design: generate as many ideas as possible, these are opportunities then reduce to ideas worth pursuing via iteration and refinement.

A figure based on [Greenberg *et al*.’s Sketching User Experiences: The Workbook](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71185020590001451), which describes the ideation process as a tree. Figure created by Jon Froehlich for his HCI/design courses and informed also by [Tohidi *et al.*, NordiCHI’06](https://doi.org/10.1145/1182475.1182487). See [this slide deck](https://www.dropbox.com/s/66gzb6i7bciz2hr/HCID501_L04-Ideation.pptx?dl=0).
As [Professor Igarshi emphasizes](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/writings/siggraph.html)(The quote is lightly edited for brevity), “*The best way to come up with a [promising research topic] is to come up with many possibilities, examine them carefully, and pick the best one. You must list 100 possible research ideas first, carefully investigate the possibility of 30, implement 10, and pick the most successful one in the end. You must understand that 100 good ideas are discarded in the process of producing one paper.*” Two-time Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling agrees: *“The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.*”
But how long should you spend ideating? Sometimes, you are in a context that is inherently timeboxed—for example a summer internship. Other times, it may feel open ended. Together, we should work through this process. For example, when I interned with [John Krumm](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jckrumm/) at Microsoft Research, I remember feeling anxious to quickly select and start working on a research topic. With only a 12-week internship, I feared spending too much time on the brainstorming phase(If possible, I would suggest brainstorming projects with your intern supervisor before your internship begins—my conversations with John began during a lunch meeting at [Pervasive 2007 in Toronto](https://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2021/past-conferences/).). What’s worse, by week two, it seemed that all the other interns had already downselected and were actively pushing towards a research paper. Thankfully, with John’s support, we spent time compiling ideas and finally decided to pursue end-to-end route prediction using GPS data. John’s view—and that shared by our group manager at the time [Eric Horvitz](http://erichorvitz.com/)—was that the upfront cost of brainstorming ideas and conceptualizing problem spaces was worth it compared to selecting an inferior or low-impact problem. Our resulting paper, [*Route Prediction from Trip Observations*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sae-route-prediction-camera-ready-v3.pdf), now has over 300 citations and is cited across fields from ubiquitous computing to the automotives. The project was not only successful, it greatly stretched my skillset—the first “big data” project that I worked on, which developed my skills in data cleansing and machine learning.
### One-page research pitch sheets {#one-page-research-pitch-sheets}
When thinking about topics, your inspiration may come from anywhere: drawing on your own experience, reading research literature or one of our lab’s papers, random thoughts when taking a walk or shower.
When proposing a topic, I request that you put together a one-page pitch sheet (often called “one pagers” in the lab though they often extend to two pages). Here, you should address the following questions:
- What is the problem you are solving and why does it matter?
- What have others done in this space & what are the benefits/drawbacks of those approaches?
- What is your proposed solution? (Your approach)
- How will you evaluate your solution? (Your study method)
- What are your expected research contributions? Said contributions must be contextualized and differentiated with the research literature and state-of-the-art industry systems.
Though I wrote these questions myself, they are not particularly unique but rather foundational to the beginning of any research project. They share similarities, for example, with [Heilmeier’s Catechisms](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism), a list by George H. Heilmeier, former DARPA director (1975-1977), to help agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research. Similarly, Professor Judy Olson poses [Ten Questions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16KI8_Fxj94efHpZv3xnu4TO3ufuya4pU) to ask and answer before starting a project.
Notably, to address these questions, you need to perform an in-depth analysis of the existing research literature and, when relevant, industry solutions. You simply cannot pursue a topic without first knowing the literature and situating your expected research contributions within it. At its core, the pitch sheet is an *argument* to convince us of the value of an idea, the limitations of and/or opportunities enabled by prior work, and how we will advance knowledge/understanding in a space. This must be contextualized in the literature.
To help you construct your pitch sheets, here are some examples, which we share with permission:

### Research contributions {#research-contributions}
In their [Interactions, 2016](http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/interactions-16.pdf) article, Wobbrock and Kientz enumerate seven research contributions in HCI with examples. Below, we provide a similar analysis but of Makeability Lab work, which not only illustrates the variety of work that we do and research methods that we employ but also particular tendencies/patterns in our work (*e.g.,* use of design probes to formatively explore a space, high number of artifact contributions with holistic, qualitative evaluations, *etc.*).
As you work on your own research, you need to identify key research questions, how to examine these questions (study method), and expected research contributions. In many cases, you can model your study plan and research paper on prior work from our group—if no match exists, look more broadly at the research literature to inform your planning and writing.
**Artifact contributions.** “*HCI is driven by the creation and realization of interactive artifacts*. *Artifacts, often prototypes, include new systems, architectures, tools, toolkits, techniques, sketches, mockups, and envisionments that reveal new possibilities, enable new explorations, facilitate new insights, or compel us to consider new possible futures.*” Importantly, how an artifact research contribution is demonstrated and validated depends on the type of artifact and its goal. For example, new input and interaction techniques like a new mouse cursor design ([UIST’10](https://doi.org/10.1145/1866029.1866055)), a new keyboard entry technique ([CHI’03](https://doi.org/10.1145/642611.642630)), or a new 3D selection technique ([UIST’06](https://doi.org/10.1145/1166253.1166257)) often require precise, experimental evaluations to isolate and understand human performance benefits. In contrast, new systems, architectures, tools, and toolkits are often evaluated more holistically, perhaps through qualitative usability studies or field deployments.
- A key type of artifact contribution in the Makeability Lab are systems papers with formative design inquiries and summative evaluations. For example, with MakerWear ([CHI’17](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Kazemitabaar_MakerwearATangibleApproachToInteractiveWearableCreationForChildren_CHI2017.pdf)), we conducted iterative formative design sessions with children, educators, and children’s museum employees during our design process, incorporating feedback, and then evaluating a final prototype with multi-day sessions in after-school programs. Similarly, with ARMath ([CHI’20](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Kang_ArmathAugmentingEverydayLifeWithMathLearning_CHI2020.pdf)) we ran participatory design sessions with teachers and children before creating and evaluating a final prototype in a field deployment at a local children’s museum.

Above, I emphasized that a common type of Makeability Lab systems paper includes both formative design and summative evaluation components: we typically conduct formative inquiries like interviews, early-stage co-design sessions, or surveys to inform the design of our technical systems. Often, we attempt to capture this design process in a single paper (such as [MakerWear](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Kazemitabaar_MakerwearATangibleApproachToInteractiveWearableCreationForChildren_CHI2017.pdf), [ARMath](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Kang_ArmathAugmentingEverydayLifeWithMathLearning_CHI2020.pdf), [SharedPhys](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Kang_SharedphysLivePhysiologicalSensingWholeBodyInteractionAndLargeScreenVisualizationsToSupportSharedInquiryExperiences_IDC2016.pdf)) but often, especially for dissertation-level work, our design and evaluation research is split across multiple papers.
For example, in our sound awareness research, we began with a large-scale formative survey of 201 people who identify as d/Deaf or hard of hearing to investigate preferences for interactive sound awareness systems ([CHI’19](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300276)), which led to two major threads of design and development work:
- **Sound awareness systems in the home**, including first our Wizard-of-Oz formative study ([CHI’19](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300324)) followed by building and deploying an actual system called HomeSound ([CHI’20](https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376758))
- **Watch-based solutions**, including a lab study of haptic and visualization feedback ([CHI’20](https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376406)) followed by building and evaluating a watch system called SoundWatch ([ASSETS’20](https://doi.org/10.1145/3373625.3416991))
To me, this is the essence of research: ideas beget other ideas, research findings from one project lead to another, *etc.* And your dissertation will likely follow such a process to generate a body of knowledge.
**Empirical research contributions** provide “*new knowledge through findings based on observation and data gathering… In HCI, empirical contributions arise from a variety of sources, including experiments, user tests, field observations, interviews, surveys, focus groups, diaries, ethnographies, sensors, log files, and many others. Empirical research contributions are evaluated mainly on the importance of their findings and soundness of their methods*”

### Research Methods {#research-methods}
Depending on your research questions and study goals, there are many different types of common research methods in HCI from surveys and interviews to interaction logging and lab-based experiments. As an introduction, I suggest reading Lazar *et al.’s [Research Methods in HCI](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71258179800001451)* [(2017)](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71258179800001451), which is available as an e-book from the library (I also have a hard copy in my office). Below, Makeability Lab students have kindly offered to share example study protocols and interview scripts. The folder containing these protocols is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OEThWEOPY9O_XnWbLnQ5y0KdtUo2bk1k); otherwise, click on the individual links below.
**Survey protocols**
- [An online survey protocol to gather preferences for sound awareness technologies (2018)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5Vb0I93Cxgeyxk9xynrNQe-0wS3U4qs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111759084570559606451&rtpof=true&sd=true), which led to Findlater *et al.’s* CHI’19 paper *Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Individuals’ Preferences for Wearable and Mobile Sound Awareness Technologies*. [PDF](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Findlater_DeafAndHardOfHearingIndividualsPreferencesForWearableAndMobileSoundAwarenessTechnologies_2019.pdf) | [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300276).
**Interview protocols with design probe component**
Importantly, note how these protocols: (1) have text dedicated to the research team to help ground and contextualize questions (this text is often in a different color or font)—to be clear, this is not text intended to be spoken by the research facilitator during the session, it is scaffolding, background, and context for the research team; (2) typically also include the research goal and key research questions (again, to help the research team appropriately provide feedback on questions, ensure that the questions are well-scoped and directed, *etc.*); (3) use section headers to thematically organize the interview (these subheaders often become organizational frameworks for analysis and writing up the results as well); (4) are often refined through pilot studies often starting with “friendlies” (like a member of the lab or a peer at UW) before running an external pilot with the target user group).

### Analyzing Data {#analyzing-data}
As you design your study, you should also be thinking about *what* types of data you will be collecting (*e.g.,* survey, interview; closed-form, open-form, Likert, etc.) and *how* to analyze that data. Many of our formative and system design papers have qualitative components: design probes, formative interviews, post-deployment interviews, and beyond. But how should we analyze that data?
Well, it depends 😊. And factors that will influence your analytical approach may include: the underlying research questions, the goals of your work, the type of data you’ve collected, the type of research contributions you aim to make, and even the publication venue (*e.g.,* to meet the norms of a given community). To help guide you, I suggest starting with McDonald, Schoenbebeck, and Forte’s excellent [CSCW’19 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359174) surveying the norms and guidelines for qualitative research in CSCW and HCI practice.
Then, I suggest reading over some of the papers above—perhaps with an emphasis on the papers that use the study methods most closely related to those that you’re planning.
TODO: consider expanding this more on *how* to analyze data with some helpful pointers (both qual analysis and quant analysis). For now, best way to learn about this is to read the “Analysis” section of the papers linked above. For qual analysis: Mention Hruschka, D.J., Schwartz, D., et al. Reliability in Coding OpenEnded Data: Lessons Learned from HIV Behavioral Research. Field Methods 16 , 3 (2004), 307–331 and Spall, Sharon. "Peer debriefing in qualitative research: Emerging operational models." *Qualitative inquiry* 4.2 (1998): 280-292.

### User Study Recruitment {#user-study-recruitment}
To help you create user study recruitment materials, we have collected some [examples here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uUhqLkMhN66-SEl8pAk9Sdh9--7iea69). The type of recruitment you design and execute will depend on your study and the target audience.
## Undergraduate Research and Mentorship {#undergraduate-research-and-mentorship}
A PhD is not just about developing research skills but leadership and people management skills as well. To this end, I encourage PhD students to seek out opportunities to mentor high school, ugrad, and MS students in research (at a developmentally appropriate time). Please chat with me first before taking on students in your research projects; I want to make sure that the timing and fit is right. Research mentorship is both an enormous privilege and responsibility. It also takes significant time and effort.
For undergraduate research, specifically, we ask that interested ugrads [apply here](https://forms.gle/HiqpbwX7DBNJkMQc6). Currently, Jae and Mikey help triage and interview top candidates.
Undergraduate students work directly under the supervision of a PhD student  (see our [People page](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/)) and join existing research projects. For those students interested in doing an honors thesis or an independent research project, they must first work and succeed in our lab on pre-existing research.
To help introduce students to the lab and hear about their work, we invite them to a lab meeting around **Week 8**, where we ask that they share out their research with the group and solicit feedback. Here are some examples from previous quarters:
- [Example 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12TMnrvduL_v8f5key5SWzOU45a00gig2/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109568695472870420850&rtpof=true&sd=true)
### Applying for the Allen School BS/MS Program in the Allen School {#applying-for-the-allen-school-bs/ms-program-in-the-allen-school}
Many undergrads that work with us are interested in applying for the BS/MS program. As their PhD mentor and close collaborator, you are better suited to draft an initial letter of recommendation than I am, which I can then modify and update. This also gives you valuable experience in how to write a good letter and the types of attributes in students that help make them successful (so perhaps will further aid your student recruitment in the future).
To help you draft an initial letter, here are some [examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hcvD25_PRFZ3JYCNzf_pTUXudw8sohRp)(These examples are reserved for Makeability Lab PhD students to help them craft BS/MS letters.) (confidential, please do not share). The letters are plaintext and typically ~3 paragraphs. (Note: these examples are for PhD students to help them craft BS/MS letters).
The [Allen School BS/MS form](https://admissions.cs.washington.edu/bsms/recommendations/) looks like the following (see Figure) and allows for a brief plaintext letter and a drop-down selection of *Not Recommended, Uncertain, Recommended, Strongly Recommended, and Most Strongly Recommended.* Recommendations are typically due at the end of June.

## Coursework  {#coursework}
For the first ~2 years of the PhD program, you will take seven graduate courses across three of four groups (see [list here](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/process#reqs)). Despite your best instincts and contrary to all previous educational experiences you’ve had, your grades are largely meaningless(Aha, I found that Professor Fiesler [agrees with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4QiJNPSdWs&t=121s) so it must be true!). Instead, what matters is *what* you learn in these courses and *how* these learnings translate to your research and career. With only 10-week quarters, classes are but a cursory introduction to material anyway.
In contrast, I expect you will learn more through performing research—reading literature, building systems, conducting data analysis, working with your peers, going on internships, and attending talks/conferences than you will from classes. Plus, this is the type of lifelong learning required for any research career. And ultimately, your time in graduate school will be assessed not by your grades but by your research performance and impact.
I am not against PhD coursework; I am a teacher after all! 😀 Benefits include: stretching your thinking, building initial skillsets, developing rapport with peers, and providing an awareness and knowledge of CS subdisciplines. Moreover, some of your course projects may lead to interesting research—indeed, both [BodyVis](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/project/BodyVis/) and [HandSight](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/project/handsight/) started this way! But it is a mistake to treat your PhD coursework similar to your undergrad experience: focus on learning, on advancing your skills, and, whenever possible, draw links to and double dipping with research.
Talk to fellow students (and me) for advice on which courses to take.
### Seminars {#seminars}
The Allen School has a rich history of offering 1-2 credit research seminars—which are focused on paper reading + discussion—and colloquiums, which include guest speakers and distinguished lecturers. Both the seminars and colloquiums are great opportunities to stretch your thinking, engage more deeply with new research topics, and, particularly for the seminars, learn how to analyze and discuss research texts.
However, your *time* is your most valuable asset. You must spend it wisely. There are simply too many possibilities. I encourage you to limit seminar attendance to one (possibly two) seminars per quarter and no more. While I value the benefits of seminars and you should definitely take them, my concern is “*death by a thousand cuts*”—you will simply become too bogged down by seminars, which require ~2-3 hours per week (~1-2 hours to read and think about a paper and 1 hour to attend the seminar itself).
In short, I suggest:
- Attending DUB seminar (requires no prep, provides access to a breadth of HCI topics and speakers, and includes food)
- Finding one research seminar that best aligns with your interests and dedicate yourself to fully participating (read each paper, engage in discussion)
- For 1st-year PhD students, registering and attending CSE 519 and 520 (aka colloquium) is strongly encouraged by the Allen School
In addition, UW and its various colleges/departments often attract top scholars to give talks, so there will be a variety of unplanned talks that you will likely want to attend per quarter. We also suggest attending job talks, especially from senior PhD students, as they represent the culmination of graduate work, are often filled with exciting content, and demonstrate how to frame and present ~5 years of research. See our [Academic Job Talks](#academic-job-talks) section for more detail.
## Building Online Visibility {#building-online-visibility}
Science is a socio-technical process. As you develop research expertise and begin publishing, you need to make your work visible and findable.
All Makeability Lab students should have their **own up-to-date academic websites** with, at a minimum, a brief bio and list of publications (with downloadable links). To help design your site, please search for examples online and/or use existing templates. For example, [my academic site](https://jonfroehlich.github.io) is built in Jekyll using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. You can view my [design research here](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/jonfroehlich.github.io/blob/master/DesignResearch/DesignResearch.pptx)—I personally wanted to make a clean, easily maintainable site especially since most links point back to the [Makeability Lab website](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/). As our research area is HCI, feel free to demonstrate your creativity and personality with your website design. However, remember that design is iterative and a basic, functional site is better than no site. At this point in my career, it was most important for me to make a functional, easy-to-update site. Your needs may differ.
I also suggest having professional social media accounts where you can follow the latest research developments in your area and build visibility through online interactions. I have benefited greatly from my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jonfroehlich) where I have connected with students, collaborators, and learned from and been inspired by researchers I otherwise would not. Additionally, some important SIGCHI discussions happen on Facebook in the [CHI Meta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/834637469921428/) group(I stopped using Facebook in ~2019). If you are on Facebook, I recommend joining this group. Recently, there has been movement towards Mastodon and Bluesky as well, I’m [https://hci.social/@jonfroehlich](https://hci.social/@jonfroehlich) and [https://bsky.app/profile/jonfroehlich.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/jonfroehlich.bsky.social). Our lab is: [https://bsky.app/profile/makeabilitylab.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/makeabilitylab.bsky.social)
Finally, we suggest creating **YouTube videos** of your researcher for broader impact and appeal. See [Videos](#making-research-videos) subsection. We have our own [Makeability Lab video page here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHNCPwO7WDH-Q9QG66Inwdg).
## Attending Workshops and Conferences {#attending-workshops-and-conferences}
Workshops and conferences are essential to academia—they provide interactive forums for academics and industry professionals to network, communicate recent findings, learn about emergent research, foster collaborations, and nurture a sense of community.(I was fortunate to [write a paper](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Girouard_OrganizingFamilySupportServicesAtAcmConferences_COMMUNICATIONSOFTHEACM2020.pdf) about ACM conferences, their benefits, and the need for inclusivity with Audrey Girouard, Regan Mandryk, and Mark Hancock.) For young scholars, these venues also provide an important opportunity to meet people and increase visibility.
Whenever possible, the Makeability Lab will financially support you to attend a workshop or conference if you have a first-authored paper (including travel, accommodation, registration, and per diem). In some cases, we will support participation even without a first-authored paper. In these cases, please email me to initiate a discussion and provide rationale for why attending would be valuable to your career.
When planning travel, please be frugal: register for early-bird conference deadlines (which are significantly discounted), search for the best travel and hotel rates, and look for other ways to save costs (consider, for example, applying to be a student volunteer and have your registration waived). We also ask that you search for a roommate, either a fellow UWer or, perhaps, another connection from the community. For lodging, airfare, per diem, and other travel-related policies, see the [UW Travel Services webpage](https://finance.uw.edu/travel/policyindex). We must follow official policy.
Please also see the [Reimbursement section](#reimbursements).
Serving as a student volunteer is a helpful way to save budget, participate in a conference without a first-authored paper, and network and work with other student volunteers. I am still friends with some of the people I SV’d with back in 2007 and 2008!
### Travel Grants {#travel-grants}
Both the Allen School and UW provide some travel grant opportunities. Our lab has been historically quite successful in receiving these grants.
The [Allen School Travel Grant application](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/handbook/travel-grants) is available year-round and provides up to $500 per individual request.
The UW also provides a [Travel Grant](https://depts.washington.edu/gpss/funding/travel-grants/) of up to $300 for travel in the US, $500 for international, and $300 for virtual attendance. Please read the [travel grant webpage](https://depts.washington.edu/gpss/funding/travel-grants/) and their [evaluation rubric](https://depts.washington.edu/gpss/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Travel-Grants-Rubric-2020-2021-Updated.pdf). For the worktag information, [please see this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L4G6qhXrIXMzRmFJxnHiMPHvqgzGruievQIpVESYxNE/edit).
## Internships  {#internships}
In the Makeability Lab, we strongly encourage internships. Internships allow you to experience industry-based research, learn from a new group and culture, work on new problems, forge an identity separate from your advisors, and expand your professional network—including both full-time employees as well as fellow interns.(Two relevant internship threads from #academictwitter. [Thread 1](https://twitter.com/naz_andalibi/status/1422345452058554369) from Nazanin Andalibi and [Thread 2](https://twitter.com/vj_chidambaram/status/1422359426443350027?s=20) from Professor Vijay Chidambaram.) In CS, internships are plentiful and well-compensated—you may earn (nearly) as much in a 3-month internship as you do the rest of the academic year.
When I was a PhD student, I was fortunate to intern at Intel Research (3x), Microsoft Research, and Telefónica Research where I worked with and learned from an amazing set of folks including Mike Y. Chen, Ian Smith, Sunny Consolvo, Beverly Harrison, John Krumm, and Nuria Oliver. I also established or strengthened friendships with interns like Steven Dow, Saleema Amershi, Scott Saponas, Neal Lathia—who’ve all gone on to be tech leaders(The friendships and professional networks formed amongst your peer group cannot be overestimated. As MSR researcher Irene Zhang [says](https://twitter.com/schemeprincess/status/1404845409684520960?s=20): “An internship at MSR is the best way to make friends in other departments… the #1 reason to do an MSR internship is the other interns”). These connections can last throughout your career!
Internships can potentially delay your graduation in that they typically take you away from your dissertation research—an intellectual deviation which is incredibly fruitful and worthwhile. If you can manage this, I believe the career benefits outweigh the costs.
Some questions to ask yourself and reflect on:
- Why do you want to do a PhD internship with this specific company and group?
- Who will be your direct supervisor? This is critical as you will likely work closest with them, and they will fundamentally shape your experience and learning. Additionally, they may become an important advocate for your career—maybe a letter writer.
- How have previous interns fared in said group with said person? Can you reach out to them to discuss what their experience was like? What do research interns do? What are the expectations? What is the lab culture and supervisor like?
- What kind of internship do you want? Something purely research-focused with an expectation of executing research and producing a top-tier scientific publication with 10-12 weeks? Or something development focused like a research engineer?
### When should you intern? {#when-should-you-intern?}
While each student is different and should seek internships that align with their career goals, I generally recommend interning between years 2 and 5. If you intern too early, I think you lack experience to fully contribute to and benefit from a research lab (internships are short!). If you intern too late, you’ll want to be focused on finishing your dissertation work.
For your first summer in the PhD program (between years one and two), I recommend *not* interning and, instead, working closely with your advisor on a research project (contingent, of course, on funding availability). This has multiple benefits, including strengthening ties and work rapport with your advisor and lab colleagues and digging deeper into research that may be your quals or dissertation projects. In addition, for some top industrial research groups, they generally seek interns with research experience and a proven track record (*e.g.,* they are not particularly interested in training an intern from the ground-up—a privilege of top labs).
Obviously, as noted above, an internship can also provide greater financial stability and thus can and should always be considered.
### Obtaining an internship  {#obtaining-an-internship}
Increasingly, PhD-level summer internship slots are filled in October. So, you need to start your search and application process early. I recommend the following:
- Compile an ongoing spreadsheet of industry researchers whose work inspires you and aligns with your interests. Attempt to connect with these researchers at conferences (I’m happy to make introductions).
- In October, discuss your internship goals and interests. Let’s work together to think of possibilities. Then, begin emailing said researchers about summer internship possibilities in their group. Keep the email short but make sure to include why you’re specifically interested in interning with that researcher and what value/skills you may bring to their group (try to make intellectual connections!)
## External Academic Rotations {#external-academic-rotations}
Some students may also want to consider visiting another university to work with a separate academic research group. For example, Majeed Kazemitabar spent a quarter with Professor Björn Hartmann at UC Berkeley while I was on paternity leave. This led to [Bifröst](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3126594.3126658) published at UIST’17 and generated many new connections and opportunities for Majeed. The benefits of these visiting appointments are similar to PhD internships: they enable you to experience a new lab culture and project supervisor, expand your professional and personal network, and provide new opportunities for research projects and skill development. One challenge, however, is funding. So, if you would like to investigate and possibly pursue something like this, please discuss it with me.
## Service {#service-1}
Service is the backbone of science. Scientific publications, for example, are built on peer review, which requires qualified experts to voluntarily read and write assessments of submitted work. We expect all lab members to engage in service opportunities each quarter, including things like:
- **Within the Makeability Lab**, you can volunteer to work as our web administrator, social activities chair, or meeting coordinator.
- **Within the Allen School**, you can volunteer to help maintain, promote, and improve grad life and academic culture from being a [“Friday Breakfast Coordinator”](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/orgs/gsc/officers/#fridaybreakfast) to helping review PhD applicants. Please see the [Graduate Student Officers](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/orgs/gsc/officers/) page for more details.
- **Within UW,** you can volunteer to be on the [Graduate School Senate](http://depts.washington.edu/gpss/) or a [DUB Student Coordinator](https://dub.washington.edu/gettinginvolved.html#tab_coordinators). You could help run the DUB doctoral colloquium or participate in other campus-wide initiatives.
- **Within the research community,** as you gain experience and expertise, we expect you to routinely review papers and volunteer for organizing committees. Makeability Lab students have been web design co-chairs for UIST, accessibility co-chairs for ASSETS and CHI, and even poster/demo chairs at ASSETS. For junior students, a great way to get involved in a conference is as a student volunteer. For example, read about [student volunteering](https://chi2021.acm.org/organising/student-volunteering) at CHI and how to become one.
Taking on service responsibilities will help you grow as a leader and, especially for external service, improve your visibility in the community, which may lead to future opportunities. As Liang states, “*One reward of service is public exposure: people in the academic community get to know you and these connections are important. For example, I received my first CHI paper review request from Stefanie Mueller([Stefanie](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/stefanie-mueller.html) is now a professor at MIT.) in 2015 because I had many interactions with her as a fellow student volunteer at CHI’14. Later, we collaborated on a computational fabrication literature visualization tool called [FabGalaxy](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/fabpub/fabgalaxy/).*”
