# **Meetings** {#meetings}

We have three types of regularly scheduled meetings in the Makeability Lab, each of which support us and our projects in different ways.

1. **Lab meetings.** Weekly 60 min lab meetings to share status updates, provide feedback, give practice talks, provide tutorials, and generally build lab rapport. These meetings are reserved for PhD students, postdocs, and research scientists to enable us to discuss supervisory and mentorship issues.   
2. **1:1 meetings.** Weekly 45-minute 1:1 meetings to discuss research progress, coursework, and general opportunities and challenges.  
3. **Project meetings.** Weekly or biweekly 30-60 minute project meetings led by the lead PhD(s) on the project. All project members can be invited—including high school and ugrads (though scheduling conflicts may prevent regular attendance); I defer to the lead PhD student to make these decisions. Note: Jon may not be able to regularly attend these project meetings and will, instead, provide guidance during the 1:1s.

While valuable both functionally and socially, meetings are *expensive* in terms of personnel time as well as the disruptive cost to focused work. Thus, we must use meetings wisely. If you are not prepared to meet or have no significant agenda items—which may happen due to the natural ebb and flow of graduate school (*e.g.,* you are studying for course finals)—I am always happy to cancel a meeting and interact asynchronously over email. As alumnus Majeed Kazemitabaar said, “*on MakerWear, we had great over-the-email collaborations that were very productive, including feedback on GitHub issues, sending video updates for demos and critique. We used meetings for brainstorming, designing studies, and to tackle high-level challenges.”*

## **Project Meetings** {#project-meetings}

Project meetings are led by the lead PhD student (or students). Before the meeting, the lead student(s) should prepare an agenda—soliciting agenda items from team members—and send it via email the day prior to the meeting (or early like \~5am on the day of). To help ensure that you think about timing and prioritization, the agenda should ideally have time allocations per bullet item to ensure that we adequately cover all topics. The lead student(s) will use these pre-arranged allocations to keep the meeting on track.

Meetings should begin with surfacing the prior week’s agenda items and current statuses. For this, it’s helpful to have ongoing notes with clear action items and outcomes.

From experience, we’ve found that it’s useful to send status updates from all team members via email or Slack before the meeting so that the meetings can interactively focus on issues and open questions. Some meetings become so status update heavy that they become unidirectional. When preparing for a project meeting, think about challenges you would like feedback on.

## **1:1 Meetings** {#1:1-meetings}

In 1:1 meetings (or 1:2 meetings for co-advised students), you have your advisor’s focused attention for 30 minutes. This is a valuable opportunity and a time to discuss roadblocks, map out plans, and seek advice. Please take full advantage\! I have found that how students approach these meetings, their preparedness, and their ability to run them successfully correlates strongly with success. Thirty minutes is not a long time but it is enough time, if you are prepared.

To help you prepare for 1:1s and to help maximize our time together, I request two things:

1. Create a bullet-pointed agenda that you send the night before we meet. Agendas should roughly follow this structure; however, other structures are possible(Professor Eric Gilbert has a [four-step 1:1 meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdpejrM0UyEfh9j9Srj3OZjB8Sq-iuUaMzcEHRKvcRU/edit) with: (1) New ideas (10 mins); (2) Papers that you’ve read that are interesting/influential/important (5 mins); (3) Research project discussion, including progress updates, new findings, new questions, and misc (40 mins), and (4) Next steps (5 mins). UBC postdoc [Amee Trivedi](https://ameetrivedi.github.io/) shared an alternative [meeting structure](https://twitter.com/amee_tweets/status/1446231271353434113?s=11) on Twitter. The key is: you must prepare for an effective meeting.) (we can work together on finding a structure that works best for you):  
   1. **Key goal for the meeting.** Identify at least one key goal for this week’s meeting  
   2. **General update.** How are things going? How do you feel? How can I help?  
   3. **Accomplishments for the week.** During this time, we will use the previous week’s status document to contextualize discussion. This is critical for continuity.  
   4. **Roadblocks/challenges.** What are your blockers? What is slowing you down?   
   5. **Goals and next steps.** What are your action items? What are my action items?  
2. For the meeting itself, please use Google Docs, Google Slides, a Miro board or some other tool to structure the meeting and take notes. Having a tangible resource to guide the meeting (and for notes) helps us stay on track and also results in better feedback.

The most effective meetings tend to be those with artifacts I can review and contribute to—sketches of ideas, mockups, paper outlines, initial analyses, early findings. In contrast, it is typically *not* the best use of my time to look over paper drafts—this requires deep, focused attention, which is not possible during a meeting. Thus, please send any writings beforehand so I can carefully read them on my own time and provide written feedback (asynchronously), which we can review, as necessary, during the meeting.
