# **Making research videos** {#making-research-videos}

Creating videos of your research is both a norm and expectation in HCI, particularly for UIST-style innovation or system work. While time consuming, creating a strong video to highlight your work can draw broad interest. Think about this: **magnitudes more people will view your videos than ever read your papers.** And the cost of preparing a strong video is amortized as you‚Äôll be able to use video clips in your talk, on the Makeability Lab website, and more. So, we should aim to make videos for every project in our group\! üìΩ

This [‚ÄúMakeability Lab How to Videos‚Äù guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Pn10VnlFd-9J8ampzJb3aWN5ro_tsoHnpxICGtQehw/) includes some exemplary videos curated by our lab as well as some guiding principles on making a good video.

Here are some example videos from our group:

* [ProtoSound video](https://youtu.be/H4JWZgAF5dY), CHI‚Äô22  
* [ARMath video](https://youtu.be/nUC0toUJZUk), CHI‚Äô20  
* [Ondul√© video](https://youtu.be/Zln1WlrDQ-4), UIST‚Äô19  
* [ProtypAR video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/332772744), IDC‚Äô19  
* [Project Sidewalk video](https://youtu.be/F3voLirScmY), CHI‚Äô19   
* [TouchCam video](https://youtu.be/VREiWI_38BQ), IMWUT‚Äô17  
* [MakerWear video](https://youtu.be/14Fa_VOJHIA), CHI‚Äô16  
* [SharedPhys video](https://youtu.be/eRIO4AzPd8s), IDC‚Äô16  
* [BodyVis video](https://vimeo.com/164630179), CHI‚Äô15

## **Uploading and sharing videos** {#uploading-and-sharing-videos}

As a lab, we decided in 2024 that our default option was to upload videos under the [Makeability Lab YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/makeabilitylab) account to create uniformity and maximize visibility; however, you are still welcome to instead upload your video to a personal account and we can link it with the [Makeability Lab playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zln1WlrDQ-4&list=PL1vJN5d51Q50Q9FFRGmJtXUKdQh40EbuF).

Note: we have tried other video hosting services in the past but they do not seem to draw as large of audiences (*e.g.,* [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/164630179)).

## **Intro sequence** {#intro-sequence}

Movie studios famously [use intro sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3vYVjrVrEM) for branding and visibility. Research labs do this too (*e.g,.* [see example from Chris Harrison‚Äôs Future Interfaces Group](https://youtu.be/W42EgodN5Hg?si=REqX1FWRzAjVK-BH)). At UMD, some high school students and I collectively made the ‚ÄúHCIL Hackerspace‚Äù intro sequence in Adobe After Effects ([see example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUDvIB4vv0Q)); however, we never made one for the Makeability Lab (though I long wanted to\!).

Now, at UW, we finally have our intro sequence creating programmatically using p5.js and a custom reverse explosion animation (see [p5.js program](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Art/MakeabilityLabAnimation2-ReverseExplosion/)). My vision is to create an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù number of these intro sequences based on this program (with different start locations, easing functions, and other animations). For now, I‚Äôve exported one sequence and created three different videos:

* [Makeability Lab Intro Sequence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YahGZJlaFbp_IHnMD0E4gCgwBAUw89Xv/view?usp=drive_link) (2 secs)  
* [Makeability Lab Intro Sequence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-A7LesRbQW29bUv70NJkumrUq2yPfP0s/view?usp=sharing) (5 secs)  
* [Makeability Lab Intro Sequence with DUB and CSE Logos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjQl9Uk0jvd99uFN0xUpMY_qW6E_Xv9w/view?usp=drive_link) (4.5 secs)

## **Adding captions** {#adding-captions}

Creating accessible videos is important and a key ethic of our lab. It is best to *not* burn in your captions but rather to generate .srt or .vtt files that can be uploaded to YouTube or other services (.vtt files can also be associated with videos in PowerPoint to be able to selectively turn on/off captions). Our group recommends three captioning approaches:

* Adobe Premiere has built-in captioning tools, including automatic speech-to-text recognition  
* If you don‚Äôt have access to Premiere, we suggest [Happyscribe](https://www.happyscribe.com/subtitle-tools/add-subtitles-to-video) and [Flixier](https://flixier.com/)
